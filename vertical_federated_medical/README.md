# 🏥 Vertical Federated Medical AI Revolution

## Track 2: Open-ended Decentralized Revolution

### 🎯 Project Vision

This project creates a revolutionary **Vertical Federated Learning** system that enables healthcare organizations to collaboratively train AI models while preserving patient privacy and data sovereignty. Unlike traditional federated learning that works with the same features across participants, vertical FL allows different organizations to contribute different types of data about the same patients.

## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1. **Multi-Modal Vertical Federated Learning**

- **Medical Images** (Hospitals): X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, pathology slides
- **Clinical Records** (Clinics): Lab results, vital signs, medications, diagnoses
- **Demographics** (Insurance): Age, gender, insurance status, socioeconomic factors
- **Genomics** (Research Centers): Genetic markers, family history, risk factors

### 2. **Automated Data Harmonization**

- **Schema Alignment**: Automatically map different medical coding systems (ICD-10, SNOMED, etc.)
- **Modality Translation**: Convert between different medical data formats
- **Temporal Alignment**: Synchronize data across different time periods
- **Quality Assessment**: Automatically assess and improve data quality

### 3. **Contribution-Based Reward System**

- **Data Quality Rewards**: Higher rewards for high-quality, diverse data
- **Model Performance**: Rewards based on contribution to global model accuracy
- **Privacy Preservation**: Bonus rewards for maintaining strict privacy standards
- **Collaboration Incentives**: Rewards for active participation and data sharing

## 📊 Data Harmonization Pipeline

### Automated Schema Mapping

```python
# Example: Different coding systems for the same condition
ICD10_MAPPING = {
    "diabetes": ["E11", "E10", "E13"],  # ICD-10 codes
    "hypertension": ["I10", "I11", "I12"]
}

SNOMED_MAPPING = {
    "diabetes": ["44054006", "46635009"],  # SNOMED codes
    "hypertension": ["38341003", "59621000"]
}

# Automatic alignment across different systems
```

### Multi-Modal Data Fusion

```python
# Combine different data types for the same patient
patient_data = {
    "images": hospital_xray_features,      # From Hospital A
    "lab_results": clinic_lab_features,   # From Clinic B
    "demographics": insurance_demo_features, # From Insurance C
    "genomics": research_genetic_features   # From Research Center
}
```

## 🎁 Contribution Reward System

### Reward Calculation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_contribution_reward(supernode_id, round_results):
    """
    Calculate rewards based on multiple factors:
    1. Data quality and diversity
    2. Model performance contribution
    3. Privacy preservation
    4. Active participation
    """

    # Data Quality Score (0-100)
    data_quality = assess_data_quality(supernode_id)

    # Model Performance Contribution (0-100)
    performance_contribution = calculate_performance_impact(supernode_id, round_results)

    # Privacy Score (0-100)
    privacy_score = assess_privacy_compliance(supernode_id)

    # Participation Score (0-100)
    participation = calculate_participation_rate(supernode_id)

    # Weighted reward calculation
    total_reward = (
        data_quality * 0.3 +
        performance_contribution * 0.4 +
        privacy_score * 0.2 +
        participation * 0.1
    )

    return total_reward
```
